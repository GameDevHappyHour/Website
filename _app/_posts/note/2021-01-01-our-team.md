## THE COMMUNITY FOR HONG KONG'S GAMING INDUSTRY
Welcome to Game Dev Happy Hour! We are a community of game developers here to foster and encourage game development in Hong Kong.

From students to professionals, indie to AAA, or everything else in between, we welcome all with an active interest in game development.

Our growing community is built to support Hong Kong, with regular networking events, school and university programs, and support and sponsorship for hackathons like Global Game Jam.

## Organisers

### Aidan Price

Previously involved with the IGDA Hong Kong chapter, he organised monthly meet ups for developers in Hong Kong which eventually led to Game Dev Happy Hour. While Aidan currently resides in the UK since early 2017, he continues to be involved as an adviser.

### Johnson Siau

Events Coordinator - Production assistant at Hanaji Games.

While studying in Boston, he enjoyed his time attending local game developer events and so sought to develop a community in Hong Kong when he returned.
