We tend to think the development process as a single line with a beginning and end. Yet as developers continuously start and stop various projects, it inevitably becomes an overwhelming tree of unfinished branches among the few completed ones. But what if we view it as a loop instead? A circular pipeline that exercises the flow from ideation to execution and back again. Join Vidhvat as he introspects on his circular development theory and how it drives creativity and skill as a solo developer.

Game Dev Happy Hour is a community of game developers here to foster and encourage game development in Hong Kong. The primary event is the monthly social, always on the first Thursday every month, which features a community presentation, local announcements, and general socializing.
