A unique mashup of football and martial arts, Kojum is both a competitive fighter and an objective-based sports game. With both genres so uniquely their own, combining the two was a design challenge. It proved to be a process, one that changed and evolved over time with the added stress of being a one person team. Well join us as Joshua reflects the dual design of Kojum and the journey of a solo developer!

Game Dev Happy Hour is a community of game developers here to foster and encourage game development in Hong Kong. The primary event is the monthly social, always on the first Thursday every month, which features a community presentation, local announcements, and general socializing.
