The smallest bit of personalised voice acting or foley sounds can go a long way, but there's more to it all than just remembering to hit 'record'! Even without access to a professional recording studio, with some basic knowledge of acoustic and audio equipment, you too can record quality audio in your room. Join Christopher as he shares audio recording practices for unideal circumstances.

Game Dev Happy Hour is a community of game developers here to foster and encourage game development in Hong Kong. The primary event is the monthly social, always on the first Thursday every month, which features a community presentation, local announcements, and general socializing.
