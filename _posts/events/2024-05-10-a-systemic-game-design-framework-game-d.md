We can immediately recognise extraordinary design in games, yet it's not as simple trying to design something as unique. Often it can become a misguided endless loop of iteration, but perhaps taking a different perspective can inform future design. Join Sky as he lays a systemic framework to understanding a game's mechanics and how it can guide design.

Game Dev Happy Hour is a community of game developers here to foster and encourage game development in Hong Kong. The primary event is the monthly social, always on the first Thursday every month, which features a community presentation, local announcements, and general socializing.
