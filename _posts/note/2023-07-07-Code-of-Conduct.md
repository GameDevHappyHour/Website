This event Code of Conduct applies to all virtual and in-person events. All attendees, participants, volunteers, organizers, speakers, partners, sponsors are required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct.

We expect our community to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to respect the Code of Conduct outlined below. This code will be enforced throughout our events to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

Any behavior that contravenes the spirit of Game Dev Happy Hour's Code wonâ€™t be tolerated. We expect that everyone should show respect and courtesy to each other at our events.

We prohibit any form of bullying, harassment, maltreatment, unreasonable discrimination on grounds of:
- ancestry, including colour and perceived race
- nationality or national origin
- ethnic background or origin
- religion or creed, or religious belief, religious association, or religious activity
- age

Harassment of any form will not be tolerated at our events.

### What is harassment?
Harassment is abusive and unwelcome behaviour that degrades, demeans, humiliates, or embarrasses a person. It is a form of discrimination when it is based on one of the protected grounds (ancestry, sex, religion, etc, or other protected category mentioned above). The person experiencing the harassment may have informed the harasser the behaviour is unwelcome or the behaviour may be deemed unwelcome if a reasonable
person in those circumstances would view it that way.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: 
- offensive verbal behaviour
  - comments
  - innuendo
  - jokes
  - threats
  - deadnaming
  - misgendering,
- gestures and other non-verbal behaviour
  - touching or unnecessary physical contact
  - visual forms of harassment (posters, videos)
  - physical behaviour (pushing, shoving)
  - electronic harassment (emails, text messages, displaying graphic images)
  - sustained disruption of talks or other events
  - unwelcome sexual or physical/virtual attention, unwelcome sexual solicitations oradvances.

### What to do if harassed or witness harassment?
- If you can, make it clear to the harasser that their behaviour is unwelcome.
- Keep a record of the incident(s) including a description of unwanted behaviour, times, places, and witnesses.
- Anyone who is asked to stop any harassing behavior, is expected to comply immediately.
- If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from an event with no refund and they may be banned from subsequent events and membership. The person who has been asked to leave due to harassment must do so immediately, quietly, and without drawing attention to themselves during the encounter and afterwards.
- If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact the event organizers present at the event for assistance or report an incident anonymously here.

## Why is this policy important?
Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.
