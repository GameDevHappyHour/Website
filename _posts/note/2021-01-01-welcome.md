Welcome to Game Dev Happy Hour! We are a community of game developers here to foster and encourage game development in Hong Kong.

From students to professionals, indie to AAA, or everything else in between, we welcome all with an active interest in game development.

Our growing community is built to support Hong Kong, with regular networking events, school and university programs, and support and sponsorship for hackathons like Global Game Jam.
